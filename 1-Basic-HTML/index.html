    <p style="color:#b8c5e6"> Community Computing is a PPP class. In it, we use our knowledge of coding and computer science to serve the community.</p>
    <p style="color:#b8c5e6">To prepare for this work, we’ll learn some exciting new tools and concepts. We will learn the Python language, with a focus on using algorithms to sort and manipulate data. We’ll look at how programming languages interface with each other in real world applications. </p>

          <p style="color:#b8c5e6">This year, we will be making projects for the community that are based primarily around programming. Last year some projects that were made include an online sandwich order form, a table selector to randomly assign table groups in class, a game for algebra 1, and much more. These are just some ideas, but there are many more opportunities. If you would like to have a project made, please fill out the google form down below. *Note that not all projects will be created because of class size and time restrictions*</p>
